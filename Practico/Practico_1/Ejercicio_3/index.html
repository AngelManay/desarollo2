    </h3>
    <p>
      A big part of what we learned in UX comes from online reading: articles,
      tutorials, resources, blogs. Its all available out there, for free - and
      all you have to do is invest some time to dig it up.
    </p>
    <p>But there's a lot.</p>
    <p>
      UX is becoming increasingly popular, and with that comes a lot of clutter,
      noise and disorientation. The
      <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

      >
      is our attempt at curating and sharing UX content with our community in a
      more digestible way.
